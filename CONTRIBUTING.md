How to contribute

First of all, thank you for taking the time to contribute to this project. I have tried to make fun project to collect Ciphers 

Writing some code!

Contributing to a project on Github is pretty straight forward. If this is you're first time, these are the steps you should take.

    Claim an issue
    Fork this repo
    Code up a Cipher
    Write a couple tests
    Profit

And that's it! You're change should not break the existing code and should pass the tests.

If you're adding a new functionality, start from the branch main. It would be a better practice to create a new branch and work in there.

When you're done, submit a pull request and for one of the maintainers to check it out. We would let you know if there is any problem or any changes that should be considered.
